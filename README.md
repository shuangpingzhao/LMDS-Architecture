# LMDS-Architecture 
Layered Meaning-Decision System – A cognitive architecture for human behavior, internal alignment, and meaning-driven decisions.

## Overview  
LMDS (Layered Meaning-Decision System) is a seven-layer cognitive architecture that explains human behavioral inconsistency, internal conflict, and misalignment.  
The model proposes that human action does not arise from a single cause, but from structural interactions among seven internal layers.  
LMDS offers a meaning-centric foundation for future cognitive science and human–AI understanding.

This repository contains the conceptual foundation of LMDS v1.0 and will be expanded with mechanism-level models (v1.1), meaning development theory (v2.0), and future computational applications.

## LMDS v1.0 – Seven-Layer Architecture  
- **Layer 1: Sensation**  
- **Layer 2: Emotion**  
- **Layer 3: Logic**  
- **Layer 4: Expression**  
- **Layer 5: Action**  
- **Layer 6: Decision**  
- **Layer 7: Meaning**  

LMDS proposes that human behavior emerges from interactions, alignment, and misalignment between these layers.  
Meaning (Layer 7) provides long-term integration, direction, and identity formation.
